My stage code works as expected and performs well

My commit also works as expected and performs well.

I did not do checkout

For my commit method I did initially have trouble with it printing the parent class, however I was able to debug the method and fix it. The problem was that I was incorrectly getting the parent hash from the linked list which caused errors in the method.
